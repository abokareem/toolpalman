Community Supported Devices
===========================

The community supported devices are only supported by the community. In other words, maintenance,
bug, corrections and features are developed by members of the XiVO community. XiVO does not
officially endorse support for these devices.

``xivo-provd`` plugins for these devices can be installed from the
:ref:`"community supported devices" repository <alternative-plugins-repo>`.

Note that you *must not* download the firmware for these phones unless you
agree to the fact it comes from a non-official source.

For the plugin to work fully, you need these additional packages::

   apt-get install p7zip python-pexpect telnet

   For best results, activate :ref:`dhcp-integration` on your XiVO.

.. note::
   These devices can be used to connect Faxes. For better success with faxes some parameters
   must be changed. You can read the :ref:`fax-analog-gateway` section.

.. note::
   If you want to manually resynchronize the configuration from the ATA device
   you should use the following url::

     http://ATA_IP/admin/resync?http://XIVO_IP:8667/CONF_FILE

   where :

      * *ATA_IP*    is the IP address of the ATA,
      * *XIVO_IP*   is the IP address of your XiVO,
      * *CONF_FILE* is one of ``spa2102.cfg``, ``spa8000.cfg``

XiVO only supports configuring the FXS ports of these gateways. It does not support configuring the
FXO ports. If you have a gateway on which you would like to configure the FXO ports, you'll need to
write the FXO ports configuration manually by creating a :ref:`custom template
<provd-custom-templates>` for your gateway.

It's only possible to enter a provisioning code on the first FXS port of a gateway. For example, if
you have a gateway with 8 FXS ports, the first port can be configured by dialing a provisioning code
from it, but ports 2 to 7 can only be configured via the XiVO web interface. Also, if you dial the
:ref:`"reset to autoprov" extension <reset-to-autoprov-device>` from any port, the configuration of
all the ports will be reset, not just the port on which the extension was dialed. These limitations
might go away in the future.

These gateways are configured with a few regional parameters (France by default). These parameters
are easy to change by writing a :ref:`custom template <provd-custom-templates>`.

Telnet access and web access are enabled by default. You should change the default password by
setting an administrator password via a XiVO "template device".

By downloading and installing the Patton firmwares, you agree to the `Patton Electronics Company
conditions <http://www.patton.com/legal/eula.asp>`_.

To provision a gateway that was previously configured manually, use the following commands
on your gateway (configure mode), replacing XIVO_IP by the IP address of your XiVO server::

   profile provisioning PF_PROVISIONING_CONFIG
     destination configuration
     location 1 http://XIVO_IP:8667/$(system.mac).cfg
     activation reload graceful
     exit

   provisioning execute PF_PROVISIONING_CONFIG

.. warning:: If you are using Snom phones with HA, you should not assign multiple lines to the same device.

There's a known issue with the provisioning of Snom phones in XiVO:

* After a factory reset of a phone, if no language and timezone are set for the "default config device" in :menuselection:`XiVO --> Configuration --> Provisioning --> Template device`, you will be forced to select a default language and timezone on the phone UI.

.. [1] ``Tested`` means the device has been tested by the XiVO development team and that
       the developers have access to this device.
.. [2] ``Fkeys`` is the number of programmable function keys that you can configure from the
       XiVO web interface. It is not necessarily the same as the number of physical function
       keys the device has (for example, a 6757i has 12 physical keys but you can configure 30
       function keys because of the page system).
.. [3] ``XiVO HA`` means the device is confirmed to work with :ref:`XiVO HA <high-availability>`.
.. [4] These devices are marked as ``Not Tested`` because other similar models using the same firmware have been tested instead.
       If these devices ever present any bugs, they will be troubleshooted by the XiVO support team.
